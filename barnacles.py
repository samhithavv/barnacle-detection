# first need to establish how many barnacles even exist in the first image - so circle and color detection (need to store the count of how many circles there are) - but this is not the first step i want to implement

# then need to compare results with the algorithm i develop for the main image
# ideally, program draws circles over the barnacles it detects and counts how many appear - prints the number to the console


# so filter using hsv to get the green? not sure what the value of that will be
# then use contour filtering to find the circles
